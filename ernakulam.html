    <h1>ERNAKULAM</h1>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;background-color: black;margin: 1%;border-color: black;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;padding: 1%;">
        Ernakulam refers to the eastern, mainland portion of the twin cities of Ernakulam-Kochi in central Kerala, India. Located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, Ernakulam is a booming business metropolis. It is often referred to as the commercial capital of Kerala. Ernakulam has been a part of human settlements since the Stone Age. Rock-cut caves and dolmens are still a part of this city. Ernakulam was ruled by the Chera Dynasty and later, by the Kingdom of Cochin (Perumpadapu Swaroopam).
        <br><br>
        The Kerala High Court, the Office of the Corporation of Cochin and the Cochin Stock Exchange are situated here. Initially, Ernakulam was the headquarters of the Ernakulam District but was later shifted to Kakkanad. Ernakulam was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin. It is located 220 kilometres towards north-west of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. 
        The city has served as an incubator for many Malayali entrepreneurs and is a major financial and commercial hub of Kerala.
        Sprawling, residential Ernakulam is known for Marine Drive, a busy waterfront promenade where boats offer backwater cruises. The Kerala Folklore and Hill Palace museums explore local heritage through art and antiquities. Shops along Broadway and on MG Road sell fabrics, crafts, and spices, while modern Lulu Mall also has a cinema and an ice rink. Simple eateries serve Keralan specialties and South Indian seafood.
